# Capstone
The final Capstone project:

The major aim of this project is to create a platform to automate disease diagnosis. Keeping in mind that a system developed wonâ€™t take over the job of an actual human doctor but would assist the doctors to do their job easily.

Our main aim from this project is to create a platform that can help doctors in disease diagnosis and to help individuals to cure disease in the early stage. Most models out in the market are trained with a large amount of data, for the project we aim to do it on the data we have.  We believe our system will help doctors to aid their decision-making abilities for disease diagnostics.

The study uses MCA, KModes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
