# Capstone
The final Capstone project:

The major aim of this project is to create a platform to automate disease diagnosis. Keeping in mind that a system developed won’t take over the job of an actual human doctor but would assist the doctors to do their job easily.

Our main aim from this project is to create a platform that can help doctors in disease diagnosis and to help individuals to cure disease in the early stage. Most models out in the market are trained with a large amount of data, for the project we aim to do it on the data we have.  We believe our system will help doctors to aid their decision-making abilities for disease diagnostics.

The study uses MCA, KModes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
